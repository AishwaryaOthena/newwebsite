Hello, fellow digital wanderer. Welcome to this little corner of the web that I call home.

## Bio

I'm Aishwarya Athena, a PhD research scholar at [International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in). My work focuses on accessibility and disability studies in the Global South, specifically on education for children with disabilities. When I'm not chasing elusive and obscure research ideas, you will find me in the middle of a pile of tactile art materials and children's toys. It is equally likely that you will find my mind deep inside a book, or 2, or 3.
